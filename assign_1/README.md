#Assignment 1

In this assignment, you will complete the implementation of a class of single linked list. There are three test files to test the correctness of your 
implementation. To build the executables `test1`, `test 2` and `test 3`, type `make` at the command line.  Then run each of the tests and confirm the 
outputs match what are expected. 
```
$ make
$ test1
$ test2
$ test3
```
