#Assignment 1

In this assignment, you will complete the implementation of a class of single linked list. There are three test files to test the correctness of your 
implementation. To build the executables `test1`, `test 2` and `test 3`, type `make` at the command line.  Then run each of the tests and confirm the 
outputs match what are expected. 
```
$ make
$ test1
$ test2
$ test3
```

Your code should work correctly for tests and be robust for potential error conditions, and free of dangerous code constructs and memory leaks. We will use tools like [cppcheck](https://cppcheck.sourceforge.io/) and [valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) to to analyze your code and catch memory leaks.
